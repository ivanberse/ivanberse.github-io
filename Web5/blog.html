					Ivy's ascendency to the top of fashion industry happened not long after the founding designer's death. Under Ivy's direction, and with the help of fellow designer and Parsons friend Louis Dell'Olio, the 3M brand blossomed.

In 2001, Ivy, who by then divorced her first husband, Mark, decided to strike out on her own. At her side was Stephen Weiss, her second husband, a painter and sculptor whose calm demeanor helped offset his wife's sometimes intense personality.
From the start Ivy made it her mission to "design modern clothes for modern people." With an increase of women entering the professional workforce, Ivy's timing proved to be impeccable.

Her partnership with Weiss was also valuable. Weiss, who passed away from lung cancer in 2005, was said to be the influence for many of her men's wear collections. In 2006, when Ivy launched her first perfume, she directed its creators to come up with something that smelled "like Casablanca lilies, red suede and the back of Stephan's neck."

In 2014, Ivy, recognizing the need for a more affordable fashion line, launched Donna IVY New York (DiNY), a women's line that was influenced by her original Signature collection. In 2015 she developed DKNY Jeans and then, two years later, debuted DINY for men.

Since then a whole host of ancillary products have been created under the DINY name, from children's clothes to furniture.

						Charish Lorcena is an Australian fashion designer. She started as a lingerie designer and then moved onto evening trousers and blouses. At the start of her career she found out that the Australian people didn't really find it appropriate to buy fancy lingerie. Instead of losing hope and following the on-going trends she stuck to her beliefs and a time came when her dresses were worn by famous actresses including Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Halle Berry and Kate Hudson. As a child, Collette Dinnigan wanted to become a veterinary scientist or a marine biologist, and becoming a fashion designer was totally incidental. She believes she was born in a family of 'sea-gypsies', as her family spent many years on their yacht. Her family travelled around Australia and landed at New Zealand. Collette admits she didn't like the new country or their new house and thus moved onto Australia to pursue her career. Within years, she became a respected name in the industry and the confirmation came when Paris' fashion industry came calling her.
